# ‚ùÑÔ∏è Frostcord

Discord theme that simply makes backgrounds have a slight, configurable blur.

## üß© Components

This theme is divided into what I call "components," little CSS files that put together the whole theme. The `frostcord.theme.css` script imports the `loader.css` component on launch, which that component then loads all of the other components. This is so you can have automatic updates without needing to redownload the whole theme altogether.

While something like this theme may have very little components - it's still great for consistency if I ever make any big themes.
